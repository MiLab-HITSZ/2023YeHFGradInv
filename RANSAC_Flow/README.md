## 2. Installation

### 2.0 Docker (If you use this, you can skip 2.1~ procedure)
install docker compose v2 from [here](https://github.com/docker/compose)
```Bash
docker compose build
docker compose run app bash
```
You can run 3. Quick Start part by running below command inside the docker.
```Bash
cd quick_start
./runjupyter_fromdocker.sh
```
Then open "localhost:8888" in your host browser.

### 2.1. Dependencies

Our model can be learnt in a **single GPU GeForce GTX 1080Ti** (12G).

Install Pytorch adapted to your CUDA version : 

* [Pytorch 1.2.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-1) 
* [Torchvision 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-1)

Other dependencies (tqdm, visdom, pandas, kornia, opencv-python) : 
``` Bash
bash requirement.sh
```


### 2.2. Pre-trained models 

Quick download : 

``` Bash

Download the results of [ArtMiner](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/ArtMiner/) : 

``` Bash
cd data/
bash Brueghel_detail.sh # Brueghel detail dataset (208M) : visual results, aligning groups of details
```

Download our training data [here (~9G)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SikcOvCJ-zznOyCRJCTGtpKtTp01Jx5g/view?usp=sharing). It includes the validation and test data as well.

## 3. Quick Start

A quick start guide of how to use our code is available in [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/quick_start/demo.ipynb)

</p>


## 4. Train

### 4.1. Generating training pairs 

To run the training, we need pairs that are coarsely aligned. We provide a [notebook](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/generate_coarse_aligned_pair.ipynb) to show how to generate the training pairs. Note that, we also provide our training pairs in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SikcOvCJ-zznOyCRJCTGtpKtTp01Jx5g/view?usp=sharing). 



### 4.2. Reproducing the training on MegaDepth 

The training data need to be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SikcOvCJ-zznOyCRJCTGtpKtTp01Jx5g/view?usp=sharing) and saved into `./data`. The file structure is : 

```
./RANSAC-Flow/data/MegaDepth
├── MegaDepth_Train/
├── MegaDepth_Train_Org/
├── Val/
└── Test/
```

As mentioned in the paper, the model trained on MegaDepth contains the following 3 different stages of training: 

* Stage 1 : we only trained the **reconstruction loss**. You can find the hyper-parameters in [train/stage1.sh](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/stage1.sh). You can run the training of this stage by : 
     
``` Bash
cd train/ 
bash stage1.sh
```

* Stage 2 : in this stage, we train jointly: **reconstruction loss + cycle consistency of the flow**. We started from the model trained in the stage 1. The hyper-parameters are in [train/stage2.sh](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/stage2.sh). You need to change the argument _--resumePth_ to your model path. Once it is done, run: 

``` Bash
cd train/ 
bash stage2.sh
```

* Stage 3 : finally, we trained all the three losses together: **reconstruction loss + cycle consistency of the flow + matchability loss**. We started from the model trained in the stage 2. The hyper-parameters are in [train/stage3.sh](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/stage3.sh). You need to change the argument _--resumePth_ to your model path. Once it is done, run: 

``` Bash
cd train/ 
bash stage3.sh
```

### 4.3. Fine-tuning on your own dataset 

If you want to conduct fine-tuning on your own dataset. It is recommended to start from our MegaDepth trained model. You can see all the arguments of training by : 
 
 ``` Bash
cd train/ 
python train.py --help
```

If you don't need to predict the matchability, you can set the weight of the matchability loss to 0 (_--eta 0_ in the [train.py](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/train.py)), and set your path of images (_--trainImgDir_). Please refer to [train/stage2.sh](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/stage2.sh) for other arguments.


In case of predicting matchability, you need to tune the weight of the matchability loss (argument _--eta_ in the [train.py](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/blob/master/train/train.py)) depending on the dataset.
